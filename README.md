I was one of the website developers for UC Riverside's BioHack hackathon. This website consisted of all the information about BioHack as well as a countdown to the hackathon and a live website during the event with constant updates through social media.

I contributed by adding new sponsors to the page and update the website with any announcements. I also helped create the live website by implementing the Instagram UI into the website for live updates.
